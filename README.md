**Blynk.NCP** is a solution that off-loads connectivity to a **Network Co-Processor (NCP)**, while your application logic resides on the **Primary MCU**. This implies a [dual-Microcontroller Unit (MCU)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aP2sQWB0J9EWj8Y1h5qeyfm2aFwaNSUKnCE-k7zxVnk/present) architecture.

<details><summary><b>When to use Blynk.NCP?</b></summary>

Using Blynk.NCP is recommended if one of these is true:
- You have one of the [supported dual-MCU](#supported-boards) boards and want connect it to Blynk
- You're building a new IoT product with specific requirements for the Primary MCU, so you're adding a separate connectivity module
- You are using Blynk for retrofitting your existing products
- You have included an **AT command**-based module, but you struggle to make it work right or to achieve your product goals
- You are looking for **ridiculously low** risks, integration efforts, and time to market, along with **improved reliability** of your products

## Getting started

1. This is a **PlatformIO** project. Please install the [**VSCode plugin**][pio_vscode] or [**PlatformIO CLI**][pio_cli].
2. Clone [this repository][self] using `git`, or download it as a [`ZIP` file][self_zip].
3. Flash the Blynk.NCP firmware (***replace `nano33iot` with your board type***):
    ```sh
    pio run -e nano33iot -t upload_ncp
    ```
    > __Warning__: This overwrites both the Main MCU and the connectivity module firmware.  
    > You can [restore the stock firmware][restore] easily.
4. Open `src/main.cpp` and fill in [information from your Blynk Template](https://bit.ly/BlynkInject):
    ```cpp
    #define BLYNK_TEMPLATE_ID           "TMPxxxxxx"
    #define BLYNK_TEMPLATE_NAME         "MyDevice"
    ```
5. Upload the example project, and run the serial monitor:
    ```sh
    pio run -e nano33iot -t upload -t monitor
    ```
6. Use the Blynk iOS/Android app to configure your new device  
    Ensure that the Blynk App is installed on your smartphone and scan this QR code:  
    <img alt="Add New Device QR" src="./docs/Images/AddNewDeviceQR.png" width="250" />  
    Alternatively: Open the `Blynk App` -> click `Add New Device` -> select `Find Devices Nearby`

## Troubleshooting

If something doesn't work, try some of these solutions:
- If your board is based on a Raspberry Pi RP2040 chip, it may fail to work on Windows. Please apply [this fix][fix_windows_rp2040]
- Upgrade PlatformIO to the latest version. Run: `pio upgrade`
- Upgrade packages to the latest version. Run: `pio pkg update`
